# occam_ros2_driver
First try to get acces to color images, tile image and stitched image from camera OCCAM 60

Most code come from ros1 driver : https://github.com/civerachb-cpr/occam_ros

Tested with ros-galactic

Require indigosdk in the node folder:
http://occamvisiongroup.com/indigosdk/

How to use :
ros2 run occam occam_node

TODO :
- clear everything and code properly :D
- publish raw data
- publish camera infos
